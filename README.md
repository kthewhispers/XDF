# XDF
XDF, standing for X data file, is a powerful, easy-to-read, completely customizable library used for reading and storing data. Please read the 
[XDF Wiki](https://github.com/kthewhispers/XDF/wiki) in order to understand how to use XDF, what it's all about, and the power of it.

## How do I use XDF?
Import it into your project and call its functions to use it, as it's a library. Go to the [XDF Documentation](https://github.com/kthewhispers/XDF/wiki/XDF---Documentation) in order to understand XDF's functionality.

## What could I use XDF for?
You can use XDF for a few things such as:

* Saving and reading configuration properties and values for any kind of software

* Using XDF to read and write a local, file-based, primitive database that can be interacted with by local software.

* Storing data

## It has no child properties and no property hierarchy to organize and manage complex, large amounts of data. Why use XDF?
That's a fair point. These features aren't yet implemented into XDF, but you have unlimited ways to do it yourself. No, not by coding it into XDF, but with the `setproperty()` and `getproperty()` functions. Check out ways XDF can be used, and observe it being used in programs at the [XDF Implementation Examples Wiki](https://github.com/kthewhispers/XDF/wiki/XDF---Implementation-Examples)!
